#How To...
This page briefly describes Serbench operation.

##Operate the Tool
This section describes how to prepare/configure, launch and get results back.
###Run
The solution contains a primary driver program "sb" that takes an optional configuration file as an input. 
If no file is supplied then "sb.laconf" co-located with the entry-point EXE is assumed.

```
 > sb myTestsRun.laconf
``` 

###Configure
The config file may be in either XML or Laconic formats where the later is much easier to work with.

###Get Results

##Extend The Tool / Develop
This section describes how to develop more tests and add support for more serializers.
###Develop New Tests / Cases

###Add New Serializers to Test Against
