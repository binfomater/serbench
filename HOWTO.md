#How To Use

The solution contains a primary driver program "sb" that takes an optional configuration file as an input. 
If not file is supplied then "sb.laconf" is assumed.

```
 > sb myTestsRun.laconf
``` 

The config file may be in either XML or Laconic formats where the later is much easier to work with.
