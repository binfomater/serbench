#How To...

##Operate the Tool

###Run
The solution contains a primary driver program "sb" that takes an optional configuration file as an input. 
If no file is supplied then "sb.laconf" co-located with the entry-point EXE is assumed.

```
 > sb myTestsRun.laconf
``` 

###Configure
The config file may be in either XML or Laconic formats where the later is much easier to work with.
